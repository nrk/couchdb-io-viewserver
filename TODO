* I still can't get how to return from a method when inside a catch:  
  simply doing "return myvalue" returns from the catch block but this 
  doesn't get the execution flow out of the current method. Need to fix.

* Need to find a way to isolate the core functions of the view server 
  from the methods actually running in the view. Views, though, are 
  allowed to access to a small set of functions defined in the view 
  server like "emit" or "sum". Maybe applying a different context when 
  compiling methods defined in views might do the trick.
