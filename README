couchdb-io-viewserver
======================

A CouchDB view server that allows writing view functions in Io.

This is just a little experiment to figure out how the Io programming language 
actually works. The view server protocol implementation is nearly complete, 
there are still a few parts broken though. Be kind, I'm still new to Io :)


The Io programming language
===========================

Io is a small, prototype-based programming language. The ideas in Io are mostly 
inspired by Smalltalk (all values are objects, all messages are dynamic), Self 
(prototype-based), NewtonScript (differential inheritance), Act1 (actors and 
futures for concurrency), LISP (code is a runtime inspectable/modifiable tree) 
and Lua (small, embeddable).
